# Standard Affine Lyndon Words 

This repository is made to efficiently compute affine standard Lyndon words for any given ordering, verify conjectures related to such words, and was used extensively in preparing our paper on [affine standard Lyndon words](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15432).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/corbyte/AffineStandardLyndonWords.git
    ```
2. Navigate to directory:

    ```
    cd AffineStandardLyndonWords
    ```
3. Install dependencies
